    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a licensed day care provider. Daycare is something I enjoy and have been doing for about 19 years.<br>
    My goal is to provide effective and affordable care for your children
       in a play and learn environment with love in a Christian atmosphere.<br></p>

    <h1>My Mission and Values</h1>
    <p>Aside from the parents themselves, Sally's Christian Daycare beleives nurturing families are the
        best providers of care for young children.<br>
      I believe parents, teachers and child care providers are all partners
       in children's care, development and education. Each role should be valued while respecting a parent's right
       as final arbitor for thier children. In order to best serve the needs of families in Columbia, Sally's Christian Care offers  full-time infant, toddler,
       preschool and before/after school care.<br>
       My promise to you is to always maintain a safe and healthy environment that fosters an atmosphere of social and emotional development.<br>
       My pledge is to work closely with you in propping up the pillars of your child's personal foundation: <strong>Self Esteem</strong>, <strong>Dignity</strong> and <strong>Respect</strong>.</p>
